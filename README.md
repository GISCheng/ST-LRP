## Title: A method to assess spatio-temporal units for specific tasks based on explainable artificial intelligence

## Abstract
Big geo-data are commonly aggregated into spatio-temporal units before the analysis of human activities and urban environments. Many applications categorize these data into groups and compare data characteristics across groups. The intergroup differences vary with spatio-temporal units, and the key is to identify the spatio-temporal units with apparent differences in data characteristics across groups. However, spatio-temporal dependence, data variety, and the complexity of tasks impede effective unit assessment. Inspired by the applications to extract critical image components based on explainable artificial intelligence (XAI), we propose a spatio-temporal layer-wise relevance propagation method to assess spatio-temporal units as a general solution. The method organizes input data into an extensible three-dimensional tensor form. We provide two means of labeling the spatio-temporal tensor data for typical geographical applications, using temporally or spatially relevant information. Neural network training proceeds to extract the global and local characteristics of data for corresponding analytical tasks, and then the method propagates classification results backward into units as obtained importance. We validate the method through a case study with taxi trajectory data in Beijing. The results prove that the proposed method can assess spatio-temporal units with dependence for specific tasks. This study also attempts to discover task-related knowledge using XAI.

## Statement
The program of the ST-LRP is developed based on the previous work of LRP in Github ([TensorFlow LRP Wrapper](https://github.com/VigneshSrinivasan10/interprettensor)) (Lapuschkin et al. 2016).
