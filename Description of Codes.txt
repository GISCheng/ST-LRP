1. The file "ST-LRP.zip" is the zip package of the main programs in this study. The program of the ST-LRP is developed based on the previous work of LRP in Github (TensorFlow LRP Wrapper: https://github.com/VigneshSrinivasan10/interprettensor) (Lapuschkin et al. 2016). All the programs are the Jupyter Notebook files in python (.ipynb):
(1) The file "Holiday_revise_2019.ipynb" is the program of neural network model training and the spatio-temporal unit evaluation.
(2) The file "Validation1_revise_Replaced zones.ipybb" is the program of the first validation experiment (replace the zone value of input).
(3) The file "Validation2_Regression_POI.ipynb" is the program of the second validation experiment (interpretation of unit importance measure difference based on POI data).
(4) The file "Validation3_Random forests.ipynb" is the program of the third validation experiment (use random forests to evaluate units).
(5) The file "Validation4_Cluster.ipynb" is the program of the fourth validation experiment (data compression application).

2. The file "Trained Parameters.zip" is the zip package of trained neural network parameters.
